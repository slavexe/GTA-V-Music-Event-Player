# GTA V Music Event Player
GTA V Music Event Player is a script using Script Hook V .NET that can play any Music Event in GTA V. Music Events are what play background music for missions in GTA V. They are played by calling the native function AUDIO::TRIGGER_MUSIC_EVENT, however there is no easy way to test them out and see which one sounds good for your project.
